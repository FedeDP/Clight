## Timeouts between captures during day/night/event on AC

## Timeouts between captures during day/night/event on BATT
# batt_capture_timeouts = [ 1200, 5400, 600 ];

## Dimmer timeouts on AC/on BATT. 
## Set any of these to <= 0 to disable dimmer
## in the corresponding AC state.
# dimmer_timeouts = [ 45, 20 ];

## Dpms timeouts on AC/on BATT.
## Set any of these to <= 0 to disable dpms
## in the corresponding AC state.
# dpms_timeouts = [ 900, 300 ];

## Screen timeouts on AC/on BATT.
## Set any of these to <= 0 to disable screen-emitted brightness compensation
## in the corresponding AC state.
## Disabled by default on BATT because it is quite an heavy operation,
## as it has to take a snapshot of your X desktop and compute its brightness.

# GAMMA #

## Gamma temperature during day and night
# gamma_temp = [ 6500, 4000 ];

## Your desired latitude for gamma support (surise/sunset in this location)
# latitude = 40.9;

## Your desired longitude for gamma support (surise/sunset in this location)
# longitude = 7.16;

## Force set a sunrise time
# sunrise = "7:00";

## Force set a sunset time
# sunset = "19:00";

## Duration of an "event". Clight will enter "event" mode (more frequent screen recalibrations)
## from event_duration seconds before a sunrise/sunset, until event_duration seconds after.
# event_duration = 1800;

## Enable to let GAMMA smooth transitions last (2 * event_duration),
## in a redshift-like way. 
## When enabling this, transition steps and timeouts are automatically computed
## given DAY-NIGHT temperature difference and (2 * event_duration) duration.
##
## Note that if clight is started outside of an event, correct gamma temperature
## will be immediately setted using normal parameters:
## no_smooth_gamma_transition, gamma_trans_step, gamma_trans_timeout
# gamma_long_transition = true;

## Let screen temperature match ambient brightness, like monitor backlight.
## When enabled, screen temperature won't be changed time-based.
## Note that it uses same curve points as backlight.
## Finally, it requires BACKLIGHT module to be enabled, otherwise GAMMA gets disabled.
# ambient_gamma = true;

## Delay in seconds before clight restarts working

## This may be needed because on some laptops on resume 
## screen temp is not correctly applied, with warning in logs: "Failed to set gamma temperature."
## Clight is in fact too quick to act on resume, and it is resuming before X is fully resumed;

## Curves used to match reference backlight level (computed through sensor.regression_points curves),
## to backlight level for each AC state for specific monitors.
## This allows per-monitor backlight adjustment; it means eg:
## that a 0.7 backlight level for your internal laptop monitor,
## can be mapped to 0.8 backlight level for your external monitor.
## It is mostly useful for people with internal laptop + external monitors or multiple external monitors,
## as often their backlight level will not properly match (ie: a 50% level on internal laptop can be much brighter than external monitor).
## All monitors not specified below will use default reference values (specified by sensor.regression_points curves).
## X axis: default backlight level (from 0 to 10)
## Y axis: desired backlight level adjusted for specific monitor.
## Note: arrays can be expanded up to 50 points for finer granularity.
## Customize "intel_backlight" or "acpi_video0" or whatever using your monitors IDs.
## To find monitor IDs, use Clightd:
## busctl call org.clightd.clightd /org/clightd/clightd/Backlight org.clightd.clightd.Backlight GetAll "s" ""
##
## You might ask why using a backlight-to-backlight mapping for specific monitors, instead of using
## multiple ambient_brightness-to-backlight mapping curves; fact is that this way Clight is also able to 
## set correct backlight for each monitor even when just asked to set the backlight, ie:
## when the request comes from eg: dbus API asking for a certain backlight level (IncBl, DecBl dbus methods).
## In this case, we wouldn't have an "ambient brightess" to be used to compute correct backlight level on each monitor;
## instead, we just set the requested backlight as default, and adjust to it for each monitor specified here below.
